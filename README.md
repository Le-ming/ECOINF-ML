## codes
*kNDVI and Whittaker* provides a demo showing how to calculate monthly kNDVI using Landsat data and interpolate missing data using Whittaker.

*STL and k-means* shows how to decompose time series using STL methods and perform temporal cluster analysis using trend components.

*SHAP-EML* shows how to build an ensemble model and calculate the SHAP value. 
## Sample data
*Sample data* provides the data required for the code to run.

"datas.csv" are used by SHAP-EML.

"time_series.csv" for STL and k-means.
